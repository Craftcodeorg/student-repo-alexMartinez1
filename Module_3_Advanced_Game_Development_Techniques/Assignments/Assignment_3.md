### Assignment: Develop a Mini-Game Incorporating Physics-Based Puzzles

#### Problem Statement:
Create a mini-game that challenges players to solve physics-based puzzles using the scripting techniques discussed in the lecture on automating game mechanics. The game should involve a character that can interact with various objects in the environment, such as moving blocks, levers, and platforms, to achieve a specific goal (e.g., reaching a certain point or collecting an item). This assignment will help you apply event-driven programming and the game loop concepts while enhancing your understanding of Python in game development.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework for your mini-game. You will need to expand upon this code by adding functionality to the character and the interactive objects.

```python
import random

class GameObject:
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.position = position

class Player(GameObject):
    def __init__(self, position):
        super().__init__(position)
        self.score = 0

    def move(self, direction):
        if direction == "left":
            self.position[0] -= 1
        elif direction == "right":
            self.position[0] += 1
        elif direction == "up":
            self.position[1] += 1
        elif direction == "down":
            self.position[1] -= 1

    def collect_item(self, item):
        if self.position == item.position:
            self.score += 1
            print("Item collected! Score:", self.score)

class Puzzle(GameObject):
    def __init__(self, position):
        super().__init__(position)
        self.solved = False

    def activate(self):
        if not self.solved:
            print("Puzzle activated!")
            # Logic to solve the puzzle goes here
            self.solved = True

def game_loop():
    player = Player([0, 0])
    items = [GameObject([random.randint(-5, 5), random.randint(-5, 5)]) for _ in range(3)]
    puzzles = [Puzzle([2, 2]), Puzzle([-2, -2])]

    while True:
        command = input("Enter command (move left/right/up/down or activate): ")
        
        if command.startswith("move"):
            direction = command.split()[1]
            player.move(direction)
            print("Player position:", player.position)

            for item in items:
                player.collect_item(item)

            for puzzle in puzzles:
                if player.position == puzzle.position:
                    puzzle.activate()

        elif command == "exit":
            break

# Start the game loop
game_loop()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Add Movement Logic**: Ensure that the player can move within the game world. Modify the `move` method to include boundaries so that the player cannot move outside of a defined area (e.g., x: -5 to 5, y: -5 to 5).

2. **Implement Puzzle Mechanics**: Enhance the `activate` method in the `Puzzle` class to include logic that checks if certain conditions are met (e.g., player has collected specific items) before allowing the puzzle to be solved.

3. **Create Interactive Items**: Add functionality to the `GameObject` class that allows items to be placed randomly on the map. The player should be able to collect these items, and you should keep track of how many items have been collected.

4. **Enhance User Feedback**: Improve the output messages in the game loop to provide clearer feedback about player actions (e.g., indicating when a puzzle is solved or when an item is collected).

5. **Test Your Game**: After implementing these features, run your game and test different scenarios to ensure everything works correctly. Make adjustments as necessary.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Functionality**: The mini-game must allow the player to move, collect items, and activate puzzles.
- **Code Quality**: Your code should be well-structured, with clear variable names and comments explaining your logic.
- **User Experience**: The game should provide clear feedback to the player about their actions and progress.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to add additional features or challenges to make your mini-game unique!

By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in scripting for game development and enhance your skills in Python while working on a project that aligns with your career goals in gaming.
