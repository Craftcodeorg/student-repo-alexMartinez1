## Example 5: Automating Score Tracking in Games

### 1. Introduction
Automating score tracking in games is a crucial aspect of game development that enhances player engagement and provides immediate feedback on performance. This example builds upon the key concepts discussed in the lecture "Introduction to Physics in Games," where we explored how physics principles can influence gameplay mechanics. Understanding how to effectively track and manage scores can create a more immersive experience, allowing players to focus on gameplay while the system manages the underlying mechanics.

### 2. Code Snippet
Below is a simple Python code snippet using Pygame that demonstrates how to automate score tracking in a game. The code includes comments for clarity and follows best practices for error handling.

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
pygame.display.set_caption("Score Tracking Example")
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Define variables
score = 0
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)  # Set font for displaying score

def display_score(score):
    """Function to display the current score on the screen."""
    score_text = font.render(f"Score: {score}", True, (0, 0, 0))
    screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))  # Position the score at the top-left corner

def main_game_loop():
    """Main game loop."""
    global score
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()

            # Simulate scoring when the spacebar is pressed
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                    score += 10  # Increase score by 10 for demonstration

        # Clear screen
        screen.fill((255, 255, 255))

        # Display current score
        display_score(score)

        # Update the display
        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(60)  # Limit to 60 frames per second

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main_game_loop()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Initialization**: The code begins by initializing Pygame and setting up the display window.
- **Variables**: A `score` variable is defined to keep track of the player's score. A font object is created to render the score text.
- **Display Function**: The `display_score` function takes the current score as an argument and renders it on the screen at specified coordinates.
- **Main Game Loop**: This loop continuously checks for events (like quitting or key presses). When the spacebar is pressed, the score increases by 10 points.
- **Error Handling**: The entire game loop is wrapped in a try-except block to catch and report any errors that may occur during execution.

This code snippet implements key concepts from the lecture by demonstrating how to manage game state (the score) and interact with player input, creating a responsive gaming experience.

### 4. Application
A real-world application of automating score tracking can be seen in various game genres, such as platformers or shooters, where players earn points through actions like defeating enemies or collecting items. Automating this process not only enhances gameplay but also reduces the likelihood of errors that can occur when tracking scores manually. 

By integrating automated score tracking, developers can ensure that players receive immediate feedback on their performance, which is essential for maintaining engagement and motivation. This functionality can also be expanded to include leaderboards or achievement systems, further enhancing the player experience.
