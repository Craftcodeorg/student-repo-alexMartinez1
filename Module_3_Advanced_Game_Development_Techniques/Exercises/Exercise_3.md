### Module Title: Advanced Game Development Techniques

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating a simple physics simulation that demonstrates the behavior of falling objects in a game environment. This simulation should utilize the concepts of scripting discussed in the lecture, specifically focusing on automating game mechanics. Your goal is to create a script that allows an object to fall under the influence of gravity, responding to player inputs to start or stop the simulation.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Below is a starter code template that you will complete. This code simulates the falling motion of an object and includes comments to guide you through the implementation.

```python
# Starter code for simulating falling objects

class FallingObject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = 0  # Initial position
        self.velocity = 0  # Initial velocity
        self.gravity = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

    def update_position(self, time_interval):
        # Update the object's position based on its velocity and the time interval
        self.position += _______ * time_interval + 0.5 * self.gravity * _______ ** 2
        self.velocity += _______ * time_interval  # Update velocity due to gravity

    def reset(self):
        # Reset the object's position and velocity
        self.position = 0
        self.velocity = 0

# Example usage of the FallingObject class
falling_object = FallingObject()
time_interval = 1.0  # Update every second

# Simulate the falling motion for 5 seconds
for _ in range(5):
    falling_object.update_position(time_interval)
    print(f"Position after {_+1} seconds: {falling_object.position} m")
```

#### 3. Hints:
- **Hint 1**: Recall that the position update formula involves both the current velocity and the effect of gravity over time. Think about how you can incorporate both into your calculation.
- **Hint 2**: The velocity of the object should increase as it falls due to gravity. Make sure to add the effect of gravity to the velocity in each update.
- **Hint 3**: When resetting the object, ensure that both position and velocity are set back to their initial values.

#### 4. Expected Outcome:
By completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating your understanding of how to apply physics concepts in a game development context. The final solution should:
- Accurately simulate the falling motion of an object under gravity.
- Include error handling (e.g., ensuring that time intervals are positive).
- Be well-commented, explaining each step and the reasoning behind your calculations.

### Integration
