### Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
As an aspiring game developer, you are tasked with creating a simple game that involves calculating the area of various rectangular game elements, such as platforms or obstacles. Your goal is to develop a function that calculates the area of a rectangle based on user-defined width and height. This function will be useful for determining the space needed for these elements in your game.

**Scenario**: Imagine you are designing a 2D platformer game. You need to calculate the area of a platform where the player can jump and land. The width and height of the platform will be provided by the user. Use the function you create to display the area of the platform.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
# Starter code for calculating the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(width, height):
    # Calculate area by multiplying width and height
    area = _______ * _______
    return area

# Get user input for width and height
width = float(input("Enter the width of the platform: "))  # Ensure width is a float
height = float(input("Enter the height of the platform: "))  # Ensure height is a float

# Call the function and display the result
print(f"The area of the platform is: {calculate_area(_____, _____)} square units.")
```

#### 3. Hints
- Remember that the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is **Area = Width Ã— Height**.
- Make sure to convert user inputs to the correct data type (float) before using them in calculations.
- Pay attention to indentation, as it is crucial in Python to define code blocks.
- Use comments to explain what each part of your code does; this will help make your code more readable.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
Upon completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating your understanding of basic syntax and data types in Python as discussed in the lecture. The final solution should look like this:

```python
# Starter code for calculating the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(width, height):
    # Calculate area by multiplying width and height
    area = width * height
    return area

# Get user input for width and height
width = float(input("Enter the width of the platform: "))  # Ensure width is a float
height = float(input("Enter the height of the platform: "))  # Ensure height is a float

# Call the function and display the result
print(f"The area of the platform is: {calculate_area(width, height)} square units.")
```

This exercise not only reinforces your understanding of data types and basic syntax but also provides practical experience relevant to your interests in game development. By successfully completing it, you'll enhance your coding skills and prepare for more complex programming tasks in your future projects!
