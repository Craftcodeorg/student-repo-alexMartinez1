### Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   As you embark on your journey in game development, it is essential to understand how to implement basic programming constructs. In this exercise, you will write a program that utilizes a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10. Imagine you are designing a simple game where players collect points, and you want to display the score incrementally. Your task is to create a function that simulates this scoring mechanism by printing each point earned as the player progresses through the levels.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
```python
# Starter code for implementing a scoring mechanism in a game
def print_scores():
    # Use a loop to print scores from 1 to 10
    for score in range(_____, _____):
        # Print the current score
        print("Player score:", _____)

# Call the function to display scores
print_scores()
```

3. **Hints**:
   - Remember that Python's `range()` function can help you generate a sequence of numbers. 
   - The first parameter of `range()` is inclusive, while the second parameter is exclusive. Think about how you can use these parameters to print numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Ensure that you are using the correct variable inside the `print()` function to show the current score.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   When the student fills in the blanks correctly, the output of the program should display:
   ```
   Player score: 1
   Player score: 2
   Player score: 3
   Player score: 4
   Player score: 5
   Player score: 6
   Player score: 7
   Player score: 8
   Player score: 9
   Player score: 10
   ```
   This exercise will demonstrate the student's understanding of loops in Python and their ability to apply programming concepts in a game development context. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling (if applicable), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, reinforcing the concepts discussed in Lecture 2.

### Integration
- This exercise is structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links. 

### Summary
This exercise aligns with your learning objectives by providing a practical application of loops in Python, reinforcing your understanding of foundational programming concepts necessary for game development. By completing this exercise, you will be better equipped to create interactive gameplay experiences in your future projects.
