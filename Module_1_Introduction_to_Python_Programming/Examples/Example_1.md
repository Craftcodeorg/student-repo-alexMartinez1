# Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming

## Example 1: Hello World Program

### 1. Introduction
The "Hello World" program is a classic first step for any beginner learning a new programming language. In the context of game development with Python, this simple program serves as a foundational exercise that introduces learners to the syntax and structure of Python code. Understanding how to output text is essential as it lays the groundwork for more complex tasks, such as displaying messages in a game or debugging information during development.

### 2. Code Snippet
Below is a well-commented code snippet that illustrates the concept of the "Hello World" program in Python. This example also includes error handling and follows best practices suitable for a beginner level programmer.

```python
# Hello World Program in Python

def main():
    try:
        # Print a greeting message to the console
        print("Hello, World! Welcome to Python Game Development.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any unexpected errors gracefully
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Ensure the main function runs when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The `main()` function encapsulates our program logic. This structure is important as it helps organize code and makes it reusable.
- **Try-Except Block**: The `try` block contains the code that may potentially raise an error. If an error occurs, the program jumps to the `except` block, which handles the error gracefully by printing an error message. This is particularly useful in game development where unexpected inputs or states can occur.
- **Print Statement**: The `print()` function outputs text to the console, which is a fundamental way to provide feedback to developers and players alike. In games, similar print statements can be used for debugging or displaying information on the screen.
- **Main Check**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line ensures that the `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module. This is a best practice in Python programming.

### 4. Application
In game development, outputting messages to the console can be invaluable for debugging purposes. For example, if a game character fails to load properly, developers can use print statements to track variable values and program flow, helping them identify where things went wrong. Furthermore, displaying welcome messages or instructions at the start of a game enhances user experience by guiding players on how to interact with the game.

### Integration
This example not only reinforces basic programming concepts but also ties into the core ideas discussed in Lecture 1, such as the significance of Python in game development and its ease of use for beginners. By starting with simple exercises like "Hello World," learners can build confidence as they progress towards more complex projects, ultimately achieving their goal of creating engaging games and interactive storytelling experiences.
