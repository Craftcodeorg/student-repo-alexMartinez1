Capstone Project: Create Your Own Interactive Storytelling Game

In this project, you will develop an interactive storytelling game using Python and Pygame. The game should feature:
- A compelling narrative with multiple branching paths based on player choices.
- At least three different NPCs with unique behaviors and dialogues.
- Basic physics mechanics (e.g., gravity, collision detection).
- A scoring system that reflects player decisions throughout the game.

This project will showcase your understanding of Python programming, game mechanics, AI implementation, and interactive storytelling techniques.
