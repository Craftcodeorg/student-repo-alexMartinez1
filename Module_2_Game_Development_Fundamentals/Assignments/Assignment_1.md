# Game Development Fundamentals Curriculum

## Module Title: Game Development Fundamentals

### Assignment Description
**Objective**: Develop a simple 2D game where the player collects items while avoiding obstacles.

### Lecture Content

#### Lecture 1: Introduction to Game Development Concepts

##### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of game development.
- Identify key components involved in creating a video game.
- Recognize the role of Python in game development.
- Appreciate the importance of storytelling and mechanics in engaging gameplay.

##### 2. Introduction:
Game development is an exciting field that combines creativity, technology, and storytelling. For aspiring Python Developers, understanding the foundational concepts of game development is crucial. This knowledge enhances programming skills and equips learners with tools needed to create immersive gaming experiences.

##### 3. Core Concepts:
###### A. What is Game Development?
Game development is the process of designing, creating, and releasing a video game. It encompasses various disciplines including programming, art, sound design, and storytelling.

###### B. Key Components of Game Development:
1. **Game Design**: The blueprint of the game, including rules, objectives, and gameplay mechanics.
2. **Programming**: Writing code to implement game logic, controls, and interactions. Python is popular due to its simplicity and versatility.
3. **Art and Graphics**: Visual elements that create the game's aesthetic.
4. **Sound Design**: Audio elements that enhance the gaming experience.
5. **Testing**: Identifying and fixing bugs to ensure a smooth player experience.

###### C. Importance of Storytelling:
A compelling narrative can significantly enhance player engagement. Understanding how to weave a story into gameplay mechanics is essential for creating memorable experiences.

##### 4. Practical Application:
###### Real-World Example:
In developing a platformer game (e.g., Super Mario), designers create levels that challenge players while telling a story through the environment and character interactions.

###### Code Snippet:
Here’s a simple Python code snippet demonstrating how to create a basic game loop using Pygame:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the game window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
running = True

# Game loop
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Fill the screen with a color
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Black background
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
```

##### 5. Summary:
This lecture explored fundamental concepts of game development, including its definition, key components, and the importance of storytelling. Understanding these elements is vital as learners progress in their journey toward becoming proficient Python Developers focused on game development.

##### 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into game design principles. To prepare, brainstorm ideas for your own game concept or reflect on games you enjoy and what makes them engaging.

### Assignment Components

#### Problem Statement
Create a simple 2D game using Python and Pygame where the player controls a character that collects items (e.g., coins) while avoiding obstacles (e.g., enemies). The game should feature a scoring system that increases as items are collected and ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

#### Starter Code
Below is a basic framework to get started on your game:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up display
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# Game variables
player_pos = [400, 300]
item_pos = [random.randint(0, screen_width), random.randint(0, screen_height)]
obstacle_pos = [random.randint(0, screen_width), random.randint(0, screen_height)]
score = 0
running = True

# Main game loop
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Game logic here (to be completed by students)

    # Drawing code here (to be completed by students)

    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
```

#### Detailed Instructions
1. **Step 1**: Implement player movement using keyboard inputs (arrow keys).
   - Modify the player’s position based on key presses.
   
2. **Step 2**: Create logic to check for collisions with items and obstacles.
   - If the player collects an item, increase the score by 1 and reposition the item randomly on the screen.
   - If the player collides with an obstacle, end the game.

3. **Step 3**: Add visual elements (e.g., drawing the player, items, and obstacles).
   - Use `pygame.draw` functions to represent these elements on the screen.

4. **Step 4**: Display the score on the screen.
   - Use Pygame’s font rendering capabilities to show the score in real-time.

5. **Step 5**: Test your game thoroughly to ensure it runs smoothly without bugs.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
- **Functionality**: The game should run without errors; players can move, collect items, and encounter obstacles.
- **Score Tracking**: The score should accurately reflect collected items.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-commented, and adhere to Python best practices.
- **Visual Appeal**: The game should have basic visual elements representing the player, items, and obstacles.
